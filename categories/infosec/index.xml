      <description>In 1997 I recall my VB6 college professor Mr. Shroff asked us to name a programming language.

Anyway, Mr. Shroff looks at me, asks me to name a language, and after a brief moment I remember chatting with Brandon at the upgrades counter at work and his new jump on Python.</description>
